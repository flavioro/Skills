The first thing you’ll need if you want to get better at algorithms and data structures is a solid base. This base can be learned one of several ways, either through a computer science program at university, some coding bootcamps focus a bit on the topics below, or you can learn on your own from books, videos, or online lectures. So you’ll need a basic understanding of the following topics to get started: https://medium.com/coderbyte/how-to-get-good-at-algorithms-data-structures-d33d5163353f

## 2 - Learn a new design pattern; (weekly)##

- Make projects;

- Reduce complexity;

- Code reusability;

- Clean code;

- In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns

## 3 - English; (daily)##

- What level of English do programmers need to know, if any?

- Do programmers need to know English?

- With 25% of programming jobs in the United States being done by foreign-born workers, many programmers speak English as a second language. Computer science is one career where, at least in some areas, you can get quite far without perfect English. Of course, you need to be able to communicate effectively with colleagues, but a brilliant coder with mediocre English writing skills is still a brilliant coder.

## 5 - Learn a new function of the language you work in (daily)##

- Start with the Basics;

## 6 - Keep a diary on how you solved the day's problems; (daily)##

- Keeping a diary helps to improve your writing;

- Keeping a diary can help you to remember events and activities;

## 7 - Communication and Empathy; (always)##

- Empathy is more than a feeling. It’s a skill that can be learned and applied;

- Empathy can help you identify human bias and assumptions that get built into software systems;

Why should you explicitly work to enhance your ability to empathize with others?

- You will be more likely to treat the people you care about the way they wish you would treat them;

- You will better understand the needs of people around you;

- You will more clearly understand the perception you create in others with your words and actions;

- You will understand the unspoken parts of your communication with others;

- You will better understand the needs of your customers at work;

- You will have less trouble dealing with interpersonal conflict both at home and at work;

- You will be able to more accurately predict the actions and reactions of people you interact with;

- You will learn how to motivate the people around you;

- You will more effectively convince others of your point of view;

- You will experience the world in higher resolution as you perceive through not only your perspective but the perspectives;
  of those around you.
- You will find it easier to deal with the negativity of others if you can better understand their motivations and fears.;
  Lately when I find myself personally struggling with someone, I remind myself to empathize and I immediately calm myself and accept the situation for what it is.
- You will be a better leader, a better follower, and most important, a better friend;
